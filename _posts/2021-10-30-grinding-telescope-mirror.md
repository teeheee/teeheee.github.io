# Grinding Telescope Mirror Log

## 5.10.2021

Chamfered telescope mirror edge to 2 mm. Do not use knife sharpening stone for chamfering. It is to soft. 30 minutes with the diamond dremel tool by hand did the trick. I did not use the dremel because I was afraid to chip the blank

Ground 10 wets with MOT K80. Took around 10 min. I need to get into the rhythm...

## 6.10.2021

Ground 3 h MOT K80 with 50% overhang. Sagitta was almost 2 mm.

## 7.10.2021

Ground 60 min MOT K80 with 50% overhang. Sagitta is 2,25 mm.

R = 2*Focal Length
D = Mirror Diameter 200 mm
t = Sagitta

t = R - sqrt(R² - D²/4)

| F | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| R | 1600 | 2000 | 2400 | 2800 |
| t | 3,13 | 2,5 | 2,08 | 1,79 |

=> F seems to be something around 4,5

Changed to MOT without overhang to make it spherical.
Tested with marker. It took around 30 min to reach a good sphere.

Measure R of mirror with led.

=> R = 2400 mm

The mirror is F6.
