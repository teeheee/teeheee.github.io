## Coating Telescope Mirrors

I wanted to make the coating of my 8" telescope mirror by myself, because I am cheap and I did not want to send my preciouse mirror by mail. There is a very good artical describing the process in detail. But they used a kit from angelgilding and did not give any details about the chemical reaction.
I thought when I am doing it by myself I also want to know what I am doing. So I did not buy the chemicals from angelgilding but the base chemicals used in the kit. 

**For everyone who wants to replicate this. If you just want to coat your mirror I would highly recommend to buy the kit from angelgilding. This saves alot of trouble with preparing the solution and avoids working with concentrated chemicals**

### Used Chemicals

For the coating the following chemicals are used:

* 1 l Amonia 25%: this is to much. Better use less concentrated solution
* 100 g Sn2Cl: also to much, but it is cheap and 100g can be stored easy
* 1 l Formaldehyd 37%: this is way to much. Better use less concetrated solution
* 1 kg Calcium Carbonate: you need quite alot for cleaning large surfaces
* 10 g silver nitrate: some say you need around 5 g for a 8" mirror.
* alot of distilled water from the supermarket

### Research

### Experiments

The following experiments were conducted to find the best method and describe how I decided what to do next.

### Experiment 1

1. prepare sensitizer solution **D**: 0,08 g Sn2Cl in 50 ml H2O
2. prepare silve solution **A**: 100 ml 0,06 mol/l AgNO3 + 0,42 NaOH
3. add 5 drops of Amonia to **A** to make it clear again
4. prepare reducer solution **C**: 1 drop of Formaldehyd to 100 ml H2O
 
In this experiment I did not clean the microscope slide.

Sensitize slide with **D** for 30 seconds. Then add 5 drops of **A** and **C** simultaniously.
This was the result:

Skip sensitizing. Then add 5 drops of **A** and **C** simultaniously.
This was the result:

![Test2](/img/20220404/DSC01291.JPG)

Sensitize slide with **D** for 30 seconds and put the slide in a bath of **A** and **C** mixed.
This was the result:

It is important to sensitize with Sn2Cl. Otherwise the silver does not adher to the glass. This is described in many processes. But I was curiouse because [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent) states Sn2Cl should not be used.

Also the solution is not good for bathing. It is better to spray or drop with pipett.

### Experiment 2

following the basic principale of "more is always better" I tested double the concentration of Experiment 1.
This was the result:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01292.JPG)

It seems that increasing concentration had negative effect on silver adhesion.
But I am not sure if skipping the step of cleaning was the problem

### Experiment 3

In this test I tried to follow the process of cleaning and spray coating of the microscope slide with the same concentrations like in Experiement 1.

This was the result:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01293.JPG)

It seems like the process is not the cause of my failures. I need to get the concentration right.

### Experiment 4

Since experiment 2 was the worst up until now I desided to use the solution from experiment 1 and dilute it in 3 steps from 100 % to 50 %, 25 % and 12,5 %. 

100 % solution was prepared the following way:

... TODO

Result for 100% concentrate:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01284.JPG)

Result for 50% concentrate:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01285.JPG)

Result for 25% concentrate:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01286.JPG)

Result for 12,5% concentrate:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01287.JPG)

I also tried combining 100 % solution A+B with 12,5 % solution C:
![Test4](/img/20220404/DSC01288.JPG)

It is not that obviouse in the image but the 50 % solution had the best result. The 50 % coating was also the only one that could not be whiped away with a q-tip.

### Experiment 5

TODO test ration of A to B.
