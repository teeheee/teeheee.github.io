## Coating Telescope Mirrors

I wanted to make the coating of my 8" telescope mirror by myself, because I am cheap and I did not want to send my preciouse mirror by mail. There is a very good artical describing the process in detail. But they used a kit from angelgilding and did not give any details about the chemical reaction.
I thought when I am doing it by myself I also want to know what I am doing. So I did not buy the chemicals from angelgilding but the base chemicals used in the kit. 

**For everyone who wants to replicate this. If you just want to coat your mirror I would highly recommend to buy the kit from angelgilding. This saves alot of trouble with preparing the solution and avoids working with concentrated chemicals**

### Used Chemicals

For the coating the following chemicals are used:

* 1 l Amonia 25%: this is to much. Better use less concentrated solution
* 100 g Sn2Cl: also to much, but it is cheap and 100g can be stored easy
* 1 l Formaldehyd 37%: this is way to much. Better use less concetrated solution
* 1 kg Calcium Carbonate: you need quite alot for cleaning large surfaces
* 10 g silver nitrate: some say you need around 5 g for a 8" mirror.
* alot of distilled water from the supermarket

### Research

### Experiments

### Experiment 1 from 25.1.2022

1. prepare sensitizer solution **D1**: 0,08 g Sn2Cl in 50 ml H2O
2. prepare silve solution **A1**: 100 ml 0,06 mol/l AgNO3 + 0,42 NaOH
3. add 5 drops of Amonia to **A1** to make it clear again
4. prepare reducer solution **B1**: 1 drop of Formaldehyd to 100 ml H2O
 
In this experiment I did not clean the microscope slide.

Sensitize slide with **D1** for 30 seconds. Then add 5 drops of **A1** and **B1** simultaniously.
This was the result:

Skip sensitizing. Then add 5 drops of **A1** and **B1** simultaniously.
This was the result:

Sensitize slide with **D1** for 30 seconds and put the slide in a bath of **A1** and **B1** mixed.
This was the result:

It is important to sensitize with Sn2Cl. Otherwise the silver does not adher to the glass. This is described in many processes. But I was curiouse because [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent) states Sn2Cl should not be used.

Also the solution is not good for bathing. It is better to spray or drop with pipett.
